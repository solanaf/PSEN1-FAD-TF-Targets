ATAC_final.ipynb: does analysis for ATAC-seq data (Differential Peak Analysis, Annotation, Peak Enrichment, Integration)
- Please note that this notebook is obsoleted (i.e., not all the code works, and it was for our first attempt of data analysis. The workflow is nicely labeled, though)
- Please note that gimmemotifs motif enrichment was done on WSL on a PC at home in the command line, so we do not have a working script for this tool.
